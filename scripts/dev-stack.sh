#
# dev-stack.sh — start or stop the local Canton dApp stack.
#
# The same sequence as README.md, in one command. The CIP-0103 browser wallet
# lives outside this repository and is run from there; this script brings up
# everything the wallet talks to: the LocalNet, wallet-service and the dApp.
#
# The LocalNet belongs to @bootnodedev/canton-barebones, pinned in the root
# package.json and driven from the directory holding its config. `up` scaffolds that
# directory itself, at the gitignored ./.canton-localnet; point elsewhere with a
# second argument or with CANTON_LOCALNET_DIR, in that order of precedence.
#
# Docker lifecycle is managed separately from the stack: start/quit Docker with
# `docker-up` / `docker-down` (macOS only), the Docker app, or your CLI. `up`
# and `down` assume Docker is already running and never start or quit it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh [dir]       # interactive arrow-key menu (default)
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh menu [dir]  # same as above
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh install     # install + link every workspace from the repo root (pnpm install)
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh docker-up   # macOS only: launch Docker Desktop, wait for the daemon
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh up [dir]    # start the vesting stack (LocalNet, DAR, wallet-service, bootstrap, dApp)
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh vault-up [dir]   # start the vault stack (vendored DARs, operator, dApp on 3013)
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh down [dir]  # stop every dev server and the operator, stop the LocalNet
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh vault-down [dir] # the same as down; see below
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh docker-down # macOS only: quit Docker Desktop
#   ./scripts/dev-stack.sh status [dir] # show what is currently running
#
# [dir] is the LocalNet directory, and every menu action uses it.
#
# What `up` starts (in order; Docker must already be running):
#   1. LocalNet containers           (canton-barebones start)
#   2. Builds and deploys the vesting DAR (name derived from daml.yaml)
#   3. wallet-service                -> http://localhost:3010  (background)
#   4. Bootstraps the vesting operator and its factory
#   5. dApp frontend dev server      -> http://localhost:3012  (background)
#
# What `vault-up` starts instead. The vault DARs are vendored as built artifacts, so this
# path needs no dpm and has no build step:
#   1. LocalNet containers           (canton-barebones start)
#   2. Deploys both vendored vault DARs
#   3. wallet-service                -> http://localhost:3010  (background)
#   4. Bootstraps the vault operator party, both instruments and the Vault
#   5. vault operator                (background; the vault's own signer)
#   6. vault dApp dev server         -> http://localhost:3013  (background)
#
# `down` stops every background process either stack started and stops the LocalNet, keeping
# its volumes. `vault-down` is the same action: the two stacks share wallet-service and the
# LocalNet, so there is nothing a vault-only teardown could safely leave running.
